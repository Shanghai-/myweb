			<h1>The Story of Modern Architecture in Barbados</h1>
			<h2>From plantation houses to Island Modern</h2>
			<p class="abstract">
				The island of Barbados boasts a rich and unique architectural history. It is home to a plethora of Georgian mansions adapted specifically to the island's climate, entire towns of tiny candy-colored houses, and breathtakingly beautiful modern estates open to the Caribbean air. The architecture of Barbados is some of the most interesting in the Western Hemisphere. It is also deeply intertwined with the political history of the island. The scars of slavery run deep through Barbados's architecture, a lasting thread which we can trace all the way from the lavish houses of the British plantocracy to the island modernist getaways of Oliver Messel.

		<h3>Early History</h3>

				To begin to understand the architectural history of Barbados, we must start with its political history. The island was first settled by a group of indigenous Americans as early as 2000 BCE, but only small fragments of archaeological evidence from that settlement remain. It was re-settled sometime between 350 and 650 CE by another group, called Saladoid-Barrancoids by archaeologists, who were later joined by several groups of Taíno Arawaks around 800 CE. There is abundant archaeological evidence of this joint civilization's farming techniques, an early hint at the island's agricultural future. In the 13th century, a group of native Caribs from the neighboring island of St. Vincent invaded, taking control of Barbados. The Caribs remained the dominant culture on Barbados until the early 16th century, when the Spanish Empire began to run slave raids on the island. The raids quickly decimated the island’s population, forcing natives to either flee to more mountainous islands which could more easily be defended or risk capture by the Spanish. By 1541, the Spanish thought the island to be entirely depopulated.

		<p>
			Because the early history of Barbados was so turbulent, little remained of its inhabitants before colonization. There was no existing Barbadian identity, no shared cultural fabric for the island to grow from. The existing population had been entirely wiped out. This created unique circumstances on Barbados; the island had been made into a blank canvas, a region defined solely by its climate and geography. Yet even without a defined local culture, it still produced a distinctive architectural style.

		<h3>Colonization and the Sugar Trade</h3>

			<p>
				In 1625, the English empire claimed and colonized Barbados. Its relatively flat geography made it ideal terrain for large plantations, and its location as the easternmost of the West Indian isles made it strategically and economically important. The colonists noticed the fertility of the land immediately and began to import slaves in droves to work on sugar plantations. Sugar was a particularly profitable crop, and was very well-suited to the caribbean climate. Sugar was the island's only export, with the plantations taking on an almost deified status; Barbados simply could not exist without the sugar mills, and the sugar mills could not exist without slaves. The money generated by the sugar trade attracted more and more English colonists looking to earn their fortunes. With them came a desire for sophisticated, trendy architecture. As wealth in Barbados grew, so did the demand for estates which flaunted that wealth.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the first instance of what becomes a recurring theme in Barbadian architecture: sugar prices dictating architectural change. Sugar sold very well in the 17th century, and as such the simple homes which had been built by the colonists to support the plantations were replaced with elaborate mansions in the latest English styles. When sugar prices remain stable or fall, the architecture of Barbados remains stagnant. Each new wave of wealth brings with it new buildings.

			<p>
				When Richard Ligon, an Englishman fleeing the English Civil War, arrived at Barbados in 1647, the island was already a bustling colony. The promise of wealth had drawn a wave of English craftsmen just a few years earlier who had already begun to erect elaborate buildings in place of the simple structures constructed by the earliest British settlers. This was the first time architecture &mdash; not just building &mdash; had been introduced to the island. One example of this wave of creativity is St. Nicholas Abbey, one of the only surviving Jacobean buildings in the Americas. Despite its name, the Abbey has absolutely no connection to the church; it was built as a plantation house and now serves as a museum. The house's curvillinear Dutch gables, covered entryway, and corner chimneys are all extremely faithful to the Jacobean style. This was the style of choice in England at the time, so it was only natural that it would be imported to keep the island up to date with the latest fashions. Ligon, however, denounced this sort of imported architecture. In his book <em>A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbadoes</em>, he wrote: 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				The planters never consider which way they build their houses, so long as they get them up; which is the cause that many of them are so insufferably hot, as neither themselves or any other can remain in them without sweltering.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Ligon's criticisms were apt. Because the styles and floorplans being imported were designed for the English climate and not the Barbadian, the plantation houses were often unbearably warm. The lack of adaptation struck Ligon as truly absurd; St. Nicholas Abbey, for example, was built with fireplaces and no areas open to the outside air. In response to this architectural failure, Ligon drew up his own original plans for plantation houses which would maximize airflow. The plans became very popular, and many 17th and 18th century Barbadian houses were based off of them. Unfortunately, very few of these buildings still stand. Ligon's home plans mark the first step towards the development of a Barbadian style.

		<h3>Developing a Local Style</h3>
		<div class="half-container">
			<p>
				In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, sugar plantations had taken over much of the island, and the forests had all been leveled. Thus Barbadian architects turned to local coral stone as a building material in lieu of wood. The stone was abundant, easy to quarry, and soft enough to carve. The stone could be used many different ways; it could be sawn into smooth bricks for detailed construction (seen in Villa Nova, right), chipped into rough blocks for traditional stone-and-mortar walls, or broken off into large slabs for foundations. The walls could be smoothed over with plaster to create an even finish or left rough. Although these techniques for using stone in building were not local, the resulting homes had a uniquely Barbadian flare which came from the pinkish-white hue of the coral stone. To the Barbadian architect, coral stone was like marble but more abundant and easier to work with. The emergence of a local material helped to set the island's architectural imagination free. The shift to coral stone came about right as a confluence of new architectural ideas and increasing capital swept the island, leading to the style known as Caribbean Georgian.
			</p>
			<p>
				There was more to the Caribbean Georgian style than just coral stone. It was an important architectural movement, a compromise between fashionable British architecture with the realities of the Barbadian climate. In keeping with the traditional Georgian style, Caribbrean Georgian houses featured symmetrical plans, entrance stairways, and harmoniously-arranged doors and windows. Where the Caribbean style diverged was in its openness to the outdoors; it featured large wrap-around verandahs with dramatic archways, windows with exterior shades, rounded front entries, and Demerara windows (special windows which act as passive air conditioners).

		<p>
			The focus on airflow through the house, using many of the techniques originally outlined by Ligon in <em>A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbadoes</em>, helped to define a style which was no longer just transplanted English architecture, but an actual local vernacular with its own rules and quirks. Barbadian houses were also often shorter and boasted plainer exteriors than their English counterparts in deference to the strong storms which often hit the island. The hybridization of styles represented by Caribbean Georgian is indicative of a willingness to experiment and adapt which fostered the development island's modern movements.

		<h3>The Architecture of Emancipation</h3>

		<p>
			It should not be forgotten that every site we have examined thus far has been a plantation house. The architecture of the plantocracy up to this point <em>was</em> the architecture of Barbados, despite the island's slave population vastly outnumbering its colonial population. This changed in 1834, when slavery was abolished in Barbados following a massive slave revolt in 1816.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although slavery had been abolished, plantation owners still owned nearly all the land on the island, forcing the former slaves to rent from them. This rent often took the form of sharecropping, effectively continuing slavery on the island even after it had been outlawed. In addition, plantation owners could terminate any rental agreement immediately for any reason, forcing the tenants to pick up and move at a moment’s notice. In response to the need to frequently move, the ex-slaves developed a unique form of architecture called the chattel house. These houses, named for a word meaning “moveable property,” shunned the heavy coral stone of the more permanent buildings in favor of lightweight wood imported to the island. The houses were small and not connected to their foundations, allowing them to easily be dismantled, placed into a cart, and rebuilt elsewhere.  When a Barbadian was forced to move, they would simply pick up their whole house and put it down somewhere else.

				The design of the Barbadian chattel house went beyond utilitarianism; it also quickly became a medium for personal expression. Chattel houses were often painted bright colors and adorned with locally-developed architectural features such as the bell palmet. Because the houses were designed to stay with the owners even when they moved, a great deal of effort went into customizing them and taking ownership of them. Many homeowners would build additions to the main homes, adding on sheds with extra rooms or adjoined secondary houses.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although these houses are radically different from the Caribbrean Georgian mansions which preceded them, they bear the marks of the style's influence in several places. Many chattel houses feature the same Demerara windows and entryway verandahs of their larger counterparts. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			The chattel hosue should be regarded as an incredibly important step in the development of modern architecture in Barbados. Its design is dictated by the functions it has to fulfil, which is a core modernist ideal. Larger chattel houses such as the blue one above are built from connecting several smaller units, which parallels the modernist focus on modular construction. Chattel houses exploit the inherent properties of their building material, not for structural strength like the Western modernists with reinforced concrete, but for its lightness and deconstructability. In addition, it is housing designed to solve a specific and challenging social problem. Despite its exterior appearance, the architecture of the Chattel house represents modernist ideals in many ways when examined in the context of Barbados's larger architectural history.

		<h3>The Birth of Island Modern</h3>

		<p>
			The “Bajan style” of the chattel house remained the main form of architecture on Barbados until the middle of the 20th century. As the international style swept the globe, Barbados became the incubation chamber for a new strain of modern architecture – Island Modern. Primarily developed by Oliver Messel, this style combined the rectilinear forms of the international style with local coral stone and the characteristic colonnades and verandahs of the Caribbean Georgian architecture discussed earlier. Messel also mixed in tricks he had learned as a stage designer, adding features such as cascading archways and brightly-colored accents to the formula. The resulting architecture, exemplified at Fustic House (above) and Mango Bay (below), became the standard for luxury island residences and resorts.

				Island Modern is characterized by openness. The ground floor is composed almost entirely of arches, leaving it open to the island breeze and emulating the light and airy feeling of the international style’s thin walls while still using traditional coral stone. The principle of openness also manifests itself in visual connections; there is often a sightline from the front door all the way through the ground floor to the patio and the beach or garden beyond. The upper floors of the house feature large windows designed to circulate air, and rooms set along open balconies which look down onto the patio. The Island Modern style also dictates that gardens and greenery should be incorporated directly into the building, rather than designed and tended to separately as in the earlier Caribbean Georgian homes. The resulting effect is a building which feels as though it is fully integrated with the outdoors around it, a structure in conversation with the island of Barbados. It is the culmination of Barbados's architectural history, a confluence of elements taken from as early as Ligon and as late as van der Rohe. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			For this reason, Island Modern has come to be the defining style of Barbados. Sites like Fustic House have become fashionable destinations for luxury trips. The Barbados tourism board touts the style as a symbol of the island's openness and pleasantness. It has been exported internationally to countless other sites in similar climate regions. Its lineage can be directly traced through the history of Barbadian architecture, and it is truly a product of its environment. Island Modern is a uniquely Barbadian style.
